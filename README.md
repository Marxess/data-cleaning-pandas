## Hypothesis: Shark attacks are especially common during summer afternoons

**_Introduction: I decided to focus on the correlation between shark attacks and time frames (hourly and monthly)._**

1) First of all, I did a thorough data cleaning exercise in order to properly draw conclusions.
2) Then, I took a look at fatal attacks. The bar chart you will see illustrates the split between fatal and non-fatal attacks from the whole dataset. 
3) I will then analyze how fatal attacks are distributed throughout time. In this case, we will analyze the data both on a monthly basis and on a time-of-day basis (session).
4) After conduction the analysis, I will add some closing thoughts in the conclusion and accept or reject my hypothesis.
